# Adding Recipes to this Cookbook

  - Create a fork of this repository
  - Create a branch with the name of the recipe you want to add
  - Commit your changes to your branch
    - Recipes should follow the template below and should be saved in a subfolder matching the category: in the recipe's Front Matter
    - Example file name: /_recipes/breakfast/eggs-benedict.md
    - If a folder does not exist for your recipe's category, feel at complete liberty to create one :smiley:
    - Open a Pull Request and describe the changes you are proposing

Once reviewed, pull requests can be merged into the gh-pages branch by project collaborators. This will automatically publish the changes to the public site at http://githubschool.github.io/pm-cookbook.
